This is the code that powers http://i-am-cc.org.

i-am-cc.org allows people to easily license their Instagram photos
under a Creative Commons license and provides a nice little browsing
experience and API for accessing the assets.

Manifesto
=========

Flickr has something like 200,000,000+ images licensed under Creative Commons,
making them the biggest repository of Creative Commons work in the world. CC
work from flickr is regularly used by Wikipedia, magazines, books, bloggers,
everyone!  It's downright fantastic!

Instagram gets something like 5+ million new photos a day.  If we could get
just a small fraction of people to agree to CC license their photos we could
make a huge impact.  And unlike flickr, instgram shots are basically
disposable -- few, if any, consider their instagram to be something they could
eventually make money off of (which isn't the case with flickr, which has a
really awesome professional and semi-professional photography community)

Right now I just provide a simple way to agree to license your existing photos
+ photos you'll take for the next 3 months under a CC license.  I kept the
timeframe 3 months because I don't want people to forget that they signed
up for this -- I want this to be a really legitimate repository of free images.
I'm capturing all of the Instagram API details and the i-am-cc.org API exposes
most of them.  Geo API support coming soon (like next week, when I have time)

Let's make this happen!  Help spread the word!
