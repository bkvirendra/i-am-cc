<h2>Manifesto</h2>

<p> <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> has something like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/">200,000,000+ images licensed under Creative Commons</a>, making them the biggest repository of Creative Commons work in the world. CC work from flickr is regularly used by Wikipedia, magazines, books, bloggers, everyone!  It's downright fantastic!</p>

<p>Instagram gets something like 5+ million new photos a day.  If we could get just a small fraction of people to agree to CC license their photos we could make a huge impact on the free culture movement.</p>

<p>Right now I just provide a simple way to agree to license your existing photos + photos you'll take for the next 3 months under a CC license.  I kept the timeframe 3 months because I don't want people to forget that they signed up for this &mdash; I want this to be a really legitimate repository of free images.  I'm capturing all of the Instagram API details and the <a href="/about-api/">i-am-cc.org API</a> exposes most of them.  Geo API support coming soon (like next week, when I have time)</p>

<p>Let's make this happen!  Help spread the word!</p>
